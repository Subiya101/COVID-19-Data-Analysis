#Treemap Visualization for COVID-19 Data Analysis:
In the context of our COVID-19 data analysis project, we have utilized a treemap visualization to present a hierarchical representation of COVID-19 statistics across different countries or regions. 
The treemap visually depicts the relationships between various categories and subcategories of COVID-19 data, providing insights into the distribution and magnitude of cases.
